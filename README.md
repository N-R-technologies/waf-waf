## WAF WAF Notifications
Information about the different notifications can be found in the WAF WAF manual.<br>
If using WAF WAF on your local machine, the notifications are already installed.<br>
If using docker, you may download an extension on your local machine that will display the notifications.<br>
On top of that, you may also download icons that will make the notifications more interactive.<br>
